# Introduction

Our visual editor is designed to be installed as an NPM package alongside the rest of your site. The only requirement is your site must be built using React (NextJS, Gatsby, etc). There is also no vendor lock-in, you do not *need* the editor for your website to work properly.

:::tip Note

Some of the initial setup will require code updates. If you don't have resources to do this, [reach out](https://www.gatewayweb.net/contact) to us! We offer a wide range of professional services.

## Supported CMS Platforms

We currently support the following Headless CMS platforms:
- [HyGraph](https://hygraph.com)
- [Contentful](https://contentful.com) *(beta)*

:::tip Note

If you do not see your CMS listed here, please [reach out](https://www.gatewayweb.net/contact) to us! We always consider building new integrations for customers.

## How it works

The editor connects your frontend with a headless CMS to give you a feature rich editing experience.

**You must have a content/preview endpoint setup that we can use to request the data from. There is additional details on the configuration page.**
